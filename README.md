# Breakout
I implemented this app in Swift 3 for CS393P. It demonstrates the use of the **UIDynamicAnimator** to provide physics-related capabilities and animations for its dynamic items, and provides the context for those animations. It does this by intermediating between the underlying iOS physics engine and dynamic items, via behavior objects you add to the animator.
